# Roughing It
How I learned to not die in the woods, and how it might help you not die without a house.

## Introduction
A very rough guide about how to "rough it" using simple gear and whatever is available to you. This document is a work in progress and will be added to periodically.

If you're in the United States and need help, call 211 on any phone and ask what resources are available to you.

<u>**If you are experiencing a medical emergency, consider visiting an emergency room for medical assistance.**</u>

## Essential Items
This is a rough list of some items that I believe every person who is without a home ought to have. This is not a complete list, and is derived from my experiences in the wilderness - you may not need some of these items, or you may need items not listed here. Please consider your own needs and the legality of owning these items within your locality before deciding to carry these items. I will discuss how to best use the items later in this document. In no particular order:

  - ### About 100+ feet of parachute cord

    ![parachute_cord](/images/parachute_cord.jpg)

    A type of very strong synthetic rope that is invaluable for building shelters, securing packs, and creating tools/harnesses/lanyards/etc. This can generally be acquired from outdoor equipment retailers, military surplus stores, and occasionally big-box stores.

    The best way to use parachute cord is to cut off an appropriate length for your needs, then use the flame of a lighter to melt the cut ends to prevent fraying. Tying knots in the ends of parachute cord can also prevent fraying, but not as effectively.
  
  - ### A roll of duct tape

    ![duct_tape](/images/duct_tape.jpg)
      
    Duct tape is invaluable and generally water-resistant adhesive tape that can be used both to repair items and even construct items if needed. This can generally be found anywhere; you should opt for a brand that uses fibers within the tape as it will be stronger than tapes made of only plastic. While not absolutely needed for creating a shelter with plastic tarps, duct tape helps immensely in keeping your tarps from tearing, and can be used to create accessories for shelters such as door flaps or patch holes. I will discuss how to use duct tape when creating a shelter later in this document.
  
  - ### Scissors (alternatively a knife)

    ![scissors](/images/scissors.jpg)
    
    Scissors (or even a knife) are incredibly useful for all kinds of tasks, particularly for creating shelters and making alterations to items. Please investigate the legality of owning a knife or other blades in your locality before owning this item. **Some localities may not allow you own any kind of blade**, or place restrictions on what kind of blades you may possess. Blades are invaluable tools, _but if you must, you can do without one_. You can generally acquire these at most stores or outdoors retailers.
  
  - ### Plastic Tarps

    ![plastic_tarp](/images/plastic_tarp.jpg)
    
    Plastic tarps, particularly in combination with parachute cord and duct tape, are invaluable. You can improvise backpacks, create shelters, keep your posessions dry, create rain gear to keep yourself warm and dry with tarps. I will discuss how to use tarps to create shelters extensively later in this document. I suggest owning _at least_ two 10' x 12' (ten foot by twelve foot) plastic tarps in your kit, though 3 is preferable.
  
  - ### Plastic trash bags

    ![plastic_trash_bags](/images/plastic_trash_bags.jpg)
    
    Durable plastic trash bags are very important to have; they are your best bet for keeping you belongings dry, and as a result keeping yourself dry. They can be used as storage for clothing and sleeping bags, rain gear, backpack covers, and even improvised shelters. I would suggest trying to keep 1 roll of 50 gallon trash bags with you.
  
  - ### Zipper-lock 1 gallon plastic bags

    ![zipper_lock_bags](/images/zipper_lock_bags.jpg)
    
    Zipper-lock bags are fantastic for keeping smaller items dry such as lighters, toiletries, composition notebooks and writing utensils, electronics such as phones and batteries, flashlights, and other smaller items that must be kept dry. They are are also great for keeping small clothing items like socks and underwear dry, which is essential for keeping warm.
  
  - ### A rechargeable flashlight

    ![flashlight_radio](/images/flashlight_radio.jpg)
    
    Having light available to you is both incredibly empowering and a safety consideration, making you able to perform work in the dark and stay safe near roads. I would recommend any kind of rechargeable flashlight (preferably ones with a crank handle, and not ones that are soloar-charged or that you shake as these latter two are very energy ineffecient) - requiring batteries or solar charging is not ideal as this means that you cannot create light on demand.
    
    Some also come with AM/FM radios built in, which can provide useful information about the weather, or help keep your spirits up with some entertainment. Some models can even be used to recharge phones via USB.
  
  - ### Lighters (plural)

    ![lighter](/images/lighter.jpg)
    
    You don't necessarily need lighters because you need to make fires - rather, you need lighters because you can use directed flames to cut and seal the ends of paracord, light gas stoves, or even provide light in worst-case scenarios.
    
    **It is incredibly important to practice fire safety precautions with lighters - the last thing you want is for your posessions or shelter to catch fire, or to be injured by a fire.**
  
  - ### Wool socks

    ![wool_socks](/images/wool_socks.jpg)
    
    Wool socks are very important because they are the best means of keeping your feet dry and warm, which is important for your health and comfort. They are quick to dry, warm, comfortable, and pretty easy to acquire. I suggest having _at least_ 2 pairs of long wool socks.
  
  - ### Toiletries

    ![toiletries](/images/toiletries.jpg)
    
    These include bar soap, alcohol-based hand sanitizer, toothpase, a toothbrush, a roll of toilet paper, a package of wet wipes, and nail clippers. While these items may not seem important in the grand scheme of things, they will help you keep yourself clean and healthy - some health issues may develop slowly over time as a result of not regularly cleaning your body, so it is important to be hygenic. Health complications are one of the last things you want to deal with while roughing it, and the use of soap, santizers, oral toiletries, and nail clippers will help you prevent the development of illnesses or diseases.
  
  
  - ### Layered clothing

    ![layered_clothing](/images/layered_clothing.jpg)
    
    Two common themes in this document are keeping dry and keeping warm - keeping warm follows keeping dry, and both of these rely on properly layering your clothing. You don't need large heavy coats and pants (as much as they may help you), but you do need layers of clothing with synthetic outer layers. I will discuss later in this document how you should layer your clothing and what specific items to look for. In general though, you want an inner layer of clothing that is warm and made of either wool or synthetics, a middle layer that is warmer and also made of wool or synthetics, and a synthetic outer layer that will block wind and is water resistant.

    You can read more about layered clothing rationale and techniques [on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layered_clothing).
  
  - ### Water bottles (plural)

    ![water_bottles](/images/water_bottles.jpg)
    
    Besides just having water to drink, having water available can help you cook food, clean your clothing, and clean your body. Any water bottles made of plastic will do; you should avoid glass bottles because they can easily break.

  - ### A good pair of shoes or boots

    ![footwear](/images/footwear.jpg)
    
    Continuing on keeping your feet dry and healthy, a good pair of shoes, or ideally boots, is very important. Keeping your feet dry and warm keeps you mobile and healthy, and should be one of your greatest priorities. Later in this document, I will describe how you can create a dry shelter and how to pack your backpack, which will help you keep your footwear dry and your feet dry and healthy.

    If possible, I would suggest having 2 pairs of footwear; having an extra pair of shoes that you can keep dry and switch into if your primary pair of shoes gets wet is important, and just as importantly will help you feel safer and happier.

  - ### A backpack

    ![backpacks](/images/backpacks.jpg)
    
    Any kind of backpack is important (and can even be improvised with a tarp and some parachute cord), but a "proper backpacking backpack" is the ideal piece of equipment to have for carrying your most essential belongings. Good backpacks can be expensive if bought new, though you can acquire perfectly good backpacks from thrift stores, military surplus shops, or outdoor retailers at many different prices. [External frame backpacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpack#External_frame_packs) are probably the ideal backpack to use, as even if the backpack itself has worn out, you can improvise a new backpack with tarps, duct tape, and parachute cord. I will discuss later in this document how to best utilize a backpack.

    Backpacks are important for keeping your most essential and valuable posessions with you at all times, and they can be used both as strural elements of shelters, or as pillows while sleeping. How you back your backpack is very important, and There will be an entire section later in this document about how to properly pack your backpack.
